=head1 CONFIGURATION
 
    use WebService::ThreatStack;

        api_key => '[your-api-key]',
        debug   => 1

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS


=head2 agents

List all agents assigned to your active organization.

    my $agent_list = $ts->agents(
        page  => 0,
        count => 20,
        start => '2015-04-01',
        end   => '2017-07-01'
    );

=cut

sub agents {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    organization => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    page         => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    count        => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    start        => {isa => 'Maybe[Str]', optional => 1},
    end          => {isa => 'Maybe[Str]', optional => 1}
  );

  say '[agents] Get all agents' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => 'agents', args => \%params, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 agent_by_id

Get details of an specific agent resource. The id to use is id, not agent_id.

    my $agent_info = $ts->agent_by_id(id => $agent_id);

=cut

sub agent_by_id {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    id => {isa => 'Str'}
  );

  say '[agent] Get agent by id' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => "agents/$params{id}", args => {}, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 alerts

This URI retrieves all recent Alerts related to your current active organization.

    my $alerts = $ts->alerts(
        count => 20,
        start => "2017-07-01",
        end   => "2017-07-20"
    );

=cut

sub alerts {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    organization => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    page         => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    count        => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    start        => {isa => 'Maybe[Str]', optional => 1},
    end          => {isa => 'Maybe[Str]', optional => 1}
  );

  say '[alerts] Get all alerts' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => 'alerts', args => \%params, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 alert_by_id

Every alert has a URI to fetch specific information about it. Additionally, each alert has a 
latest_events and rule attributes that provides events related to that alert and rule triggered 
respectively.

    my $alert_info = $ts->alert_by_id(id => $alert_id);

=cut

sub alert_by_id {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    id => {isa => 'Str'}
  );

  say '[alert] Get alert by id' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => "alerts/$params{id}", args => {}, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 policies

Policies object manage the alerts that will be triggered when certain events matches.
A default policy is applied to each agent on creation and custom ones can be created or 
assigned via the User Interface. Note that we’ve introduced the term ruleset to supersede 
policies – the API will be updated shortly, but any existing references to policies 
will still work as expected.

    my $policies = $ts->policies();

=cut

sub policies {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    organization => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    page         => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    count        => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1}
  );

  say '[policies] Get all policies' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => 'policies', args => \%params, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 policy_by_id

Retrieve details of a single policy object.

    my $policy_info = $ts->policy_by_id(id => $policy_id);

=cut

sub policy_by_id {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    id => {isa => 'Str'}
  );

  say '[policy] Get policy by id' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => "policies/$params{id}", args => {}, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 organizations

This resource retrieve all organizations you own or are part of.

    my $organizations = $ts->organizations();

=cut

sub organizations {
  my $self = shift;

  say '[organizations] Get all organizations' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => "organizations", args => {}, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 organization_users

This resource retrieves all users that are part of your default or active (if you 
use the organization parameter). To change the context just add organization={ORG_ID} 
to do requests on that organization context.

    my $organization_users = $ts->organization_users(id => $organization_id);

=cut

sub organization_users {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    id => {isa => 'Str'}
  );

  say '[organization_users] Get organization users' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => "organizations/$params{id}/users", args => {}, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 audit_logs

Get all audit logs

    my $audit_logs = $ts->audit_logs(
        page  => 0,
        count => 20,
        start => "2015-04-01",
        end   => "2017-07-01"
    );

=cut

sub audit_logs {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    organization => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    page         => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    count        => {isa => 'Maybe[Int]', optional => 1},
    start        => {isa => 'Maybe[Str]', optional => 1},
    end          => {isa => 'Maybe[Str]', optional => 1}
  );

  say '[audit_logs] Get all audit logs' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => 'logs', args => \%params, method => 'GET');

}



=head2 search_logs

Using the q parameter you can do arbitrary search on logs that match that 
specific string pattern. For example, you can do search of q=queue, 
q=john.doe@example.com, etc.

    my $log_results = $ts->search_logs(q => "PCI");

=cut

sub search_logs {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    q => {isa => 'Str'}, 
  );

  say '[search_logs] Return logs by query' if $self->debug;

  $self->_call(endpoint => 'logs', args => \%params, method => 'GET');
}



=head2 _call

Private method that makes call to API web service.

=cut

sub _call {
  my ($self, %params) = validated_hash(
    \@_,
    endpoint => {isa => 'Str'},
    args     => {isa => 'Maybe[HashRef]'},
    method   => {isa => enum([qw(POST GET)])}
  );

  my $headers = {
      "Authorization" => $self->api_key
  };

  my $url = $self->api_url . '/' . $params{endpoint};

  my $client = REST::Client->new();

  for ($params{method}) {
    when ('GET')  {
      say "[_call]: Making call GET $url" if $self->debug;
      my $url_args  = keys %{$params{args}} > 0 ? '?' . join('&', map {"$_=$params{args}{$_}"} keys %{$params{args}}) : '';
      $url .= $url_args;
      $client->GET($url, $headers);
    }
    when ('POST') {
      my $json_args = JSON->new->allow_nonref->utf8->encode($params{args}{data});
      say "[_call]: Making call POST $url" if $self->debug;
      $client->POST($url, $json_args, $headers)
    }
  }

  {
      response_code    => $client->responseCode(), 
      response_content => $client->responseContent()
  }
}
